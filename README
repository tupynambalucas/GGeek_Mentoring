# [cite_start]🌟 Gerenciamento Geek - Technical Mentorship & Advisory [cite: 1]

> [cite_start]**Status:** Providing specialized technical guidance and implementation support for this Capstone Project. [cite: 2]

[cite_start]This repository serves as a **technical advisory and implementation support center** for the "Gerenciamento Geek (GG)" final course project, developed by Vitória Rodrigues Ferreira[cite: 1]. [cite_start]My role is to provide specialized technical guidance, assist with architecture design, and support the implementation of key features for the system[cite: 2].

## [cite_start]🚀 Project Overview: Gerenciamento Geek (GG) [cite: 3]

[cite_start]The Gerenciamento Geek system is designed as a comprehensive management solution for the **Geek Station** retail store[cite: 3]. [cite_start]Its primary goal is to **optimize operational control** by streamlining inventory management, sales processing, and customer data handling[cite: 4].

[cite_start]This solution aims to provide management with a clear, panoramic view of store performance while equipping staff with essential tools for customer service, quick product lookups, and transaction processing[cite: 5].

## [cite_start]🔒 Access Roles and Permissions (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC) [cite: 9]

[cite_start]The system integrates distinct functionalities tailored to different access profiles, ensuring robust information flow management through strict permissioning[cite: 9].

| Profile | Key Permissions | Main Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Admin** | [cite_start]Unrestricted access to all system functionalities[cite: 10]. | [cite_start]System oversight, full data management[cite: 10]. |
| **Manager** | [cite_start]Full access to all registration, reports, and operational features[cite: 11]. | Daily operations, reporting, staff management. [cite_start]**(Restricted from deleting sales records)**[cite: 11]. |
| **Attendant** | [cite_start]Access to create/view Customer and Product lists/records[cite: 12]. | [cite_start]Customer service, product management (RF011)[cite: 12]. |
| **Cashier** | [cite_start]Access to create/view Customer, Product, and Sales lists/records[cite: 13]. | [cite_start]Sales registration (RF003)[cite: 13]. |

## [cite_start]✅ Core Functional Requirements (RF) [cite: 14]

[cite_start]The system is built around managing four main entities and ensuring efficient operational flow[cite: 14].

### 1. Entity Management & Registration

* **RF001 – Customer Registration:** Required by Attendant and Cashier profiles. [cite_start]*(Mandatory Data: Name, CPF, Phone, Gender)*[cite: 15].
* **RF002 – Product Registration:** Required by Attendant profile. [cite_start]*(Mandatory Data: Name, Price, Code, Stock Quantity, Category, Description)*[cite: 16].
* **RF003 – Sales Registration:** Required by Cashier profile. [cite_start]*(Mandatory Data: Product, Sale Date, Sale Code, Unit Price, Quantity, Linked Customer)*[cite: 17].
* **RF004 – Employee Registration:** Required by Administrator and Manager profiles. [cite_start]*(Mandatory Data: Name, CPF, Address details, Position)*[cite: 18].

### [cite_start]2. Inquiry and Listing [cite: 19]

* [cite_start]**RF005 / RF006 / RF007:** System must allow authorized staff to **Consult** detailed records for Customers, Products, and Sales[cite: 19].
* [cite_start]**RF008 / RF009 / RF010:** System must present comprehensive **Listing Tables** for Customers, Products, and Sales History for all staff[cite: 20].
    * [cite_start]*Extra Permissions:* Admins/Managers can Edit and/or Delete records in these listings (with specific sales deletion restriction for Managers)[cite: 21].

### [cite_start]3. Operational Features [cite: 22]

* [cite_start]**RF011 – Catalog Maintenance:** Attendant must be able to add, edit, and remove products from the catalog[cite: 22].
* [cite_start]**RF012 – Payment Methods:** System must process `Credit Card`, `Debit Card`, and `Cash` payments[cite: 23].

## [cite_start]🛡️ Non-Functional Requirements (RNF) [cite: 24]

[cite_start]The system prioritizes the following non-functional aspects[cite: 24]:

* [cite_start]**RNF001 – Usability:** **Intuitive and user-friendly interface** for non-advanced technical users[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]**RNF002 – Security:** Strict **Authentication** (login/password storage via encryption) and **Authorization** (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC) are mandatory[cite: 25]. [cite_start]All financial transactions must be protected and logged[cite: 26].
* [cite_start]**RNF003 – Reliability:** Implementation of **regular backup routines** to mitigate data loss risks[cite: 27].
