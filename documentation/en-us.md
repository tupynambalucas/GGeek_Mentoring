# INTEGRATOR PROJECT II: TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION

**System Name:** Geek Management (GG)  
**Version:** 1.02  
**Responsible:** Vitória Rodrigues Ferreira

## 1. OVERVIEW

The **Geek Management** system was developed to meet the operational needs of the Geek Station store. Its main purpose is to optimize stock control, sales processing, and customer data management.

The solution is based on a modern web architecture, allowing management to obtain a panoramic view of store performance and stock levels, while providing attendants and cashiers with agile interfaces for customer service, sales processing, quick product lookups, and exchange management.

## 4. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (NFR)

**NFR001 – Usability**
The web interface must be responsive, intuitive, and user-friendly, ensuring that users without advanced technical training can operate the system efficiently through the browser.

**NFR002 – Security**
* **Authentication:** Access to the system requires a login and password. Passwords must be stored with encryption (Hash) in the database.
* **Authorization:** The system must validate on the *Backend* if the request coming from the *Frontend* matches the logged-in user's role.
* **Integrity:** All financial transactions must be recorded in logs.

**NFR003 – Reliability**
The system must have regular database backup routines to mitigate data loss risks.

## 5. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

The project adopts a modern and modular architecture, divided between the production environment and development tools.

### 5.1. Production Architecture (Target)
* **Model:** Client-Server (RESTful API).
* **Back-end:** Java with JDBC and Hibernate.
* **Database:** MySQL.

### 5.2. Front-end Architecture (Client)
* **Language:** JavaScript (ES Modules), HTML5, and CSS3.
* **Build Tool:** **Vite**. Used for optimized bundling, asset management, and development server with *Hot Module Replacement* (HMR).
* **Communication:** **Axios** library for asynchronous HTTP requests.

### 5.3. Development Strategy (Mock Server)
To allow parallel Front-end development while the Java Back-end is being built, a provisional server is used:
* **Technology:** Node.js with Fastify and TypeScript.
* **Function:** Simulate Java API routes (Mock), receiving Axios requests, validating basic business rules, and returning fictitious or temporarily persisted JSON data.

## 6. PROJECT STRUCTURE (MONOREPO)

The source code is organized in a **Monorepo** format using **NPM Workspaces**. This allows managing both the Front-end and the Mock Server in the same repository, sharing configurations and simplifying script execution.
